Control flow constructs are essential in any programming language, as they allow you to dictate
the flow of execution in your programs. Rust provides a variety of control flow mechanisms, including conditional statements (if and else), loops (loop, while, and for), and pattern matching
(match). These constructs enable you to build dynamic and responsive applications by controlling
how and when different parts of your code are executed.
